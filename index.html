        <p id="p1"><img src="assets/images/profile.png" alt="my picture"/> I have worn a lot of hats in my life. I've been a carpenter, a line cook, and an educator.
        in more recent years, I have become a father. That's what I am trying to master now - parenting. I spend my days with my daughter (She's 2) and manage the home
        while my wife builds her career. She's awesome at her job.
